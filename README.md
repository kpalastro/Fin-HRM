## Overview

HRM-MLX provides a practical framework for hierarchical reasoning. It blends planning, intermediate reasoning, and execution steps into an adaptive compute graph. The model decides how many steps to perform at each level, allowing tight control over latency and resource use. This is essential for tasks that require multi-hop reasoning, robust planning, and evidence gathering across several layers of abstraction.

The MLX variant leverages modern tensor libraries to scale across hardware. It supports CPU and GPU backends, with optional accelerators in demo configurations. The design emphasizes clarity, extensibility, and reproducibility, so researchers can swap components and compare ideas without reworking the entire system.

Key goals include:

- Adaptive computation: the model allocates effort where reasoning is most valuable.
- Modular hierarchy: modules at different levels cooperate to produce a final answer.
- Reproducible experiments: clear configuration, well-documented results, and easy benchmarking.
- Interoperability: clean interfaces for data, models, and metrics.

This README describes how to use HRM-MLX, what to expect from the architecture, and how to contribute to the project.

---

## Key concepts

- Hierarchical reasoning: a top-level strategy guides mid-level reasoning. Mid-level modules produce candidate conclusions, which the bottom level can verify or refine.
- Adaptive computation: the system learns when to stop or to escalate to higher levels. This reduces wasted compute on simpler tasks and concentrates effort on harder cases.
- Multi-hop inference: the model can chain together evidence from multiple sources, reusing intermediate findings to support final conclusions.
- Reasoning templates: reusable reasoning patterns help the model structure steps, enabling faster experimentation and safer composition.
- Explainability hooks: each level emits interpretable signals that help users trace how a decision was reached.

---

## Why HRM-MLX matters

- Complex reasoning tasks often require more than a single pass. HRM-MLX offers a principled way to allocate compute across steps and levels.
- Researchers gain a framework to test hypotheses about where reasoning should happen, how to prune paths, and how to integrate external tools.
- Practitioners get a practical tool for tasks like multi-hop question answering, strategic planning in planning games, and structured planning for robotic control.
- The crisp separation of concerns makes it easier to extend or replace components without breaking the whole system.

---

## System requirements

- Python 3.8+ or 3.9+ (depending on the exact release; check the environment files for compatibility)
- NumPy, SciPy, and PyTorch or an equivalent tensor backend
- CUDA-enabled GPU for faster training and inference (optional but recommended)
- Sufficient disk space for datasets and model checkpoints (plan for 10â€“100 GB depending on data size and experiments)

Optional:
- Docker or Conda environments for reproducibility
- High-bandwidth storage for large datasets and intermediate results

Note: The design favors clarity and modularity. You can run small experiments on a workstation without a GPU, then scale up to a GPU cluster for larger runs.

---

## Getting started

A lightweight workflow to kick off a quick experiment:

- Prepare a small dataset that contains multi-hop reasoning tasks or synthetic problems designed for hierarchical inference.
- Use the sample config to initialize a minimal HRM-MLX model.
- Run a small experiment to verify end-to-end behavior.

Example steps:

- Prepare data:
  - python tools/prep_data.py --input data/sample.json --output data/processed/sample_processed.json
- Run a quick test:
  - python -m hrmlx.run --config configs/quick_test.yaml --data data/processed/sample_processed.json --output results/
- Inspect results:
  - cat results/summary.txt
  - python tools/visualize.py --input results/summary.txt --output plots/

If you want to download a released package first, navigate to the Releases section for prebuilt assets. The link above contains the necessary files and installers for various platforms. For a direct download and execution, ensure you pick the right asset for your system and follow the accompanying README inside the asset bundle. The releases page is the authoritative source for binaries and example experiments, and you can visit it anytime to check for new artifacts.

- Quick sanity check:
  - python -V
  - pip -V
  - nvcc --version (if you plan to use CUDA)

---

## Usage patterns

HRM-MLX supports several common usage patterns, depending on your task and data:

- Research experiments: test hypotheses about how to structure hierarchical reasoning. Swap modules, alter decision thresholds, and measure impact on accuracy and latency.
- Debugging sessions: run small synthetic tasks to trace how information flows between levels. Use hooks and logs to inspect intermediate results.
- Production inference: deploy a compact configuration to serve real-time or near-real-time tasks. Adaptive compute helps maintain latency targets.
- Curriculum experiments: gradually increase task difficulty to study how the model learns hierarchical strategies over time.

Key usage tips:

- Start with a small model and a small dataset to validate the pipeline. Then scale up gradually.
- Use the configuration system to trial different architectures without touching code.
- Enable verbose logging during development to understand how decisions propagate across levels.
- Keep checkpoints at regular intervals. This helps you recover quickly after interruptions and enables ablation studies.

---

## Model architecture

HRM-MLX uses a layered approach to reasoning:

- Top-level planner: sets high-level goals, selects the reasoning path, and decides when to escalate to deeper layers.
- Mid-level reasoner: constructs intermediate hypotheses, gathers evidence from modules, and prunes unlikely paths.
- Bottom-level executor: carries out concrete steps, tests hypotheses against data, and produces final outputs.
- Meta-learning signals: the system learns when to terminate a particular reasoning pass and how to allocate resources across tasks.

Inter-module interfaces are designed to be simple and explicit. Each module receives a structured input, performs a defined computation, and emits a well-defined output. The architecture encourages reuse of reasoning templates, which helps with consistency and interpretability.

An illustrative diagram can help you visualize how information flows through the hierarchy. The diagram highlights the planning, reasoning, and execution loops and shows where adaptive computation is applied. If you need a visual reference, you can find an external diagram that captures the spirit of hierarchical AI reasoning and use it as inspiration for your experiments.

- Optional: a lightweight diagram image can be included here to summarize the flow.

## Data and datasets

HRM-MLX works with a range of data formats, from simple question-answer pairs to multi-hop reasoning datasets. The framework, by design, can consume:

- Structured JSON with nested steps
- Tabular data for reasoning over features
- Text data for reading comprehension and logical inference
- Synthetic datasets created on the fly to test the hierarchical planner

Data handling features:

- Preprocessing pipelines to normalize inputs
- Tokenization adapters for different languages and alphabets
- Sanitization steps to remove leakage and ensure reproducibility
- Data augmentation hooks to stress-test hierarchical paths

If you are starting from scratch, generate a small synthetic dataset that mimics the reasoning structure you want to study. You can then expand to real-world data as you validate the pipeline.

---

## Training and fine-tuning

Training HRM-MLX involves:

- Defining a configuration that specifies the number of levels, module types, and optimization settings.
- Selecting an objective that matches your task, such as cross-entropy for classification or a custom loss for reasoning fidelity.
- Balancing compute between levels to encourage useful hierarchical behavior.
- Including regularization to prevent overfitting in the reasoning path.

General training steps:

1. Prepare data and environment.
2. Initialize the HRM-MLX model with your configuration.
3. Start a training run with a chosen optimizer and learning rate schedule.
4. Periodically validate using a held-out set and adjust hyperparameters as needed.
5. Save checkpoints and record metrics to enable reproducible experiments.

Fine-tuning can focus on:

- Adjusting the relative weight of different levels in the loss
- Modifying the stopping criteria for each level
- Introducing task-specific templates to guide reasoning
- Calibrating the exploration vs. exploitation balance in the planner

Example training command (adjust to your setup):

- python -m hrmlx.train --config configs/train_default.yaml --data data/processed/train.json --val data/processed/val.json --output outputs/

For practical use, rely on the latest release assets to get a ready-to-run setup. The Releases page contains bundles that are pre-wrapped with common dependencies, which speeds up initial experiments.

## Evaluation and metrics

Performance evaluation for HRM-MLX typically includes:

- Task accuracy on multi-hop reasoning tasks
- F1 score for structured outputs
- Latency per example and total compute cost
- Resource usage metrics such as memory footprint and FLOPs
- Robustness measures, like sensitivity to input perturbations and error propagation across levels
- Interpretability metrics, including the clarity of intermediate signals and level-wise explanations

A standard evaluation workflow:

- Run inference on a test set
- Collect per-example results and intermediate traces
- Compute metrics with a dedicated evaluation module
- Create plots to compare baselines and ablations

You can use the built-in evaluation scripts to generate reports. For deeper analysis, adapt the evaluation to your dataset and task type.

---

## Experimentation and reproducibility

The project places a strong emphasis on reproducible experiments. You can expect:

- Clear configuration files for common tasks
- Versioned datasets or dataset adapters
- Seed control for deterministic runs
- Checkpointing and snapshotting of model states
- Automated logging of metrics and hyperparameters
- Visualizations that help you compare runs side by side

To reproduce an experiment, you should:

- Use the same dataset split and seed
- Use the same model configuration unless you intentionally test a change
- Run in an environment with identical library versions or use containerized setups
- Save results in a structured directory, with a manifest that records key settings

The releases page is the best starting point to obtain a known-good setup for quick experiments. It contains artifacts that are intended to work out of the box on common hardware. You can download the assets from the releases page and begin your experiments immediately.
