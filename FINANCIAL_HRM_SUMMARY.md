# Financial HRM Model Summary

## Overview
Successfully created a Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) adapted for financial time series prediction using MLX. The model predicts the next day's high and low values from financial market data.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Data Analysis ✅
- Analyzed the financial data structure in `data/data1.csv`
- Identified 18 input features: open, high, low, close, EMA 7, Volume, RSI, RSI-based MA, and historical high/low values for previous 1-5 days
- Target variables: next day's high and low values

### 2. Data Loader (`financial_data_loader.py`) ✅
- Created a comprehensive data loader for financial time series
- Implements z-score normalization for all features
- Supports configurable sequence length and prediction horizon
- Includes train/validation split (80/20)
- Provides batch creation and denormalization utilities

### 3. Financial HRM Model (`models/financial_hrm.py`) ✅
- Adapted the original HRM architecture for regression tasks
- Modified input processing to handle financial features instead of tokens
- Added separate output heads for high and low predictions
- Maintained the hierarchical reasoning structure with ACT (Adaptive Computation Time)
- Supports configurable model dimensions and reasoning cycles

### 4. Loss Functions (`models/financial_losses.py`) ✅
- Implemented MSE and MAE loss functions for regression
- Added R² score calculation for model evaluation
- Included direction accuracy and range validity metrics
- Integrated Q-learning loss for ACT training

### 5. Training Script (`train_financial.py`) ✅
- Complete training pipeline with MLX optimizers
- Supports gradient accumulation and learning rate scheduling
- Includes checkpoint saving and loading
- Comprehensive logging and evaluation metrics

### 6. Testing and Validation ✅
- Created test script to verify model functionality
- Successfully trained model with small configuration
- Achieved reasonable performance on financial prediction task
